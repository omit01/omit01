I'm Timo, a econometrics and operational research student. I am eager to learn and enjoy turning problems into well-crafted solutions. I am highly analytical and quickly grasp complex issues. Additionally, I have a wealth of IT knowledge. I use this knowledge for my studies, my work, and in volunteer work for Scouting. I'm enthousiastic about programming, optimization and showing this in nice graphs.

In my study and during my job I work a lot with linear optimizations, solvers, regressions, predictive models, etc. I also have a solid base in mathemetics, economics and programming. Python is favorite, but R, Matlab, Java and C# are also in my skill set.

In my GitHub you can find a lot of school projects, some work for scouting and some ideas.
